There were 352 presidents who served all of 2014 and 2015.</li> <li class=\"article__unordered-list-item\">The number of presidents earning over $1 million is attributed, in part, to a market where presidents are negotiating more deferred compensation and bonus packages before they take the job.</li> <li class=\"article__unordered-list-item\">The top two earners, Wake Forest University President Nathan Hatch ($4 million) and former Emory University President James Wagner ($3.5 million) were each paid more than $2 million in deferred compensation in 2015.</li> </ul> <p class=\"article__paragraph\">The Chronicle also compares pay to presidents in context of their colleges, including looking at each institution's expenses, average tuition and fees and professor salaries.</p></div>\n"
